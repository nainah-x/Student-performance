# (Students Performance Analysis)
## by Zaynab Mohammed


## Dataset

> The Students Performance dataset originally contained 1000 rows and 8 variables (columns) consisting of both categorical and numerical variables. I created additional 2 columns which included the average score and total score of the students in the test. The dataset was sourced from kaggle.

>The dataset contains the following columns:

1. Gender: Male/Female.
2. race/ethnicity: Ethnic group A,B,C or D.
3. parental level of education: High school, some High school, College, Bachelors' degree, Associate degree,Master's degree.
4. lunch: standard/reduced.
5. test preparation course: described whether studnts completed the test preparation course or not.
6. math score: describes students score in maths out of 100%.
7. reading score: describes students score in reading out of 100%.
8. writing score: describes students score in writing out of 100%. 
9. average_score: an average of the total scores of students in all 3 subjects.
10. total_score: an addition of all the students scores combined together.

## Summary of Findings

> I noticed that the majority of students had a score within the range of 60 and 80 which is above pass mark and i thus expected that most them had completed the test preparation course, but interestingly, that's not the case. 
> I found an interesting relationship between the average score of students in the test and parental level of education, the plot revealed that the wards of parents with higher educational degrees such as Bachelor's degrees, associate's and master's degree performed better than the wards of parentals with lower educational background. 
> Also, students that had standard lunch performed better overall than students that had free/reduced lunch.
> Also, i expected to find a positive relationship between the students who had standard lunch and those that completed the test preparation course but surprisingly, there was an about equal result between the number of students who had standard lunch and did not complete the test preparation course and the number of students who had free/reduced lunch and did not complete the course. This is to say that the type of lunch the students had (standard or free/reduced) did not have much influence on whether or not they completed the test preparation course.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> 1. Student with parents that have a high educational background performed better in the test than students with parents that have a      lower educational background.
> 2. Students from ethnic group E performed better in the tests than students from any other ethnic group. 
> 3. Students who had standard lunch scored higher averagely than students who had free/reduced lunch.
